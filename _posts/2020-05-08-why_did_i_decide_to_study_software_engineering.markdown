Problem solving has always been a passion.  As a kid, I loved using legos to solve puzzles and build whatever my imagination could think up  I have enjoyed a life full of learning, acquiring a degree in Biology and Chemistry, but have always had an interest in technology and using my full skill set.  Ever since I found code, I knew this was exactly what I had been looking for throughout my life.  Software Engineering has given me the opportunity to express my skills while also enabling me some creative freedom.  As a Software Engineer, I can finally be myself while supporting my newborn son and wife.  To me, Software Engineering is more than a job, it's a lifestyle and a new found passion.  I'm incredibly excited to grow as a person and developer through Software Engineering.
