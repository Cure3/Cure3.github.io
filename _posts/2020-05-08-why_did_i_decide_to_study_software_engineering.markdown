Problem solving has always been a passion.  As a kid I loved solving puzzles and building whatever my imagination could think up using legos. I have enjoyed a life full of learning, acquiring a degree in Biology and Chemistry, but have always had an interest in technology and using my full skillset.  Ever since I found code I knew this is exactly what I had been looking for throughout my life.  Software Engineering has given me the opportunity to express my skills while also enabling me some creative freedom.  As a Software Engineer I can finally be myself while supporting my newborn son and wife.  To me Software Engineering is more than a job it's a lifestyle and a new found passion.  I'm incredibly excited to grow as a person and developer through Software Engineering.
